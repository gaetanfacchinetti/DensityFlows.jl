# Overview

DensityFlows is a lightweight package addressed to data scientists and in particular physicists who wish to emulate a rather low dimensional probability distribution efficiently from a restricted sample of points using normalizing flows. Everything implemented in this package has already been done in much more depth in various packages and normalizing flows have, in particular, been used to emulate images. The goal here is to keep things as simple as possible so that anyone unfamiliar with normalizing flows would still be able to use them, gaining a basic understanding on the go.


## Basics of normalizing flows



## From here and beyond

In order to get familiar with the code please give a look at the [manual](./manual.md) and at the detailed [example](./example.md). Any comment to the code or suggestion for improvement is welcome, please do so using the GitHub issues page if relevant. Further developement should include the implementation of conditional masked autoregressive flows (CMAF).
